1. Using a windows environment demanded some extra configurations that were solved succesfully after some research and using the acquired experience with the current project developed with Tekton. 
Time invested: 3 hours.

2. Installing all dependencies, build a basic data model, code the API, build the UI and implement pusher. Here I had some problems because I didn't use SAIL before. After reading some documentation I was able to use it and run the required commands inside docker. With the UI I didn't have a lot of complications. I decided to persist some data in the state. For the realtime functionality I had to check some documentation becase I didn't do something like this before.  
Time invested: 15 hours.
